tt1258756	Nuit de Chine	"documentary china today resembles night - filled with imagination. for a long period of time china was a country that did not like to discuss darkness or night. for decades the ""red sun"" was the most direct form of allowed imagination. under today's sun office buildings and construction sights dominate one's vision. but in the evening everything changes, and you can see the spiritual life of the people. evenings everywhere provide us with an opportunity to see ourselves, as through a mirror's reflection. in the evenings humanity is always more sensitive and vulnerable. in its darkness we are cloaked in intimacy and obscurity. all through the day, people work hard to put on and maintain appearances, and daytime resembles a stage on which people perform. yet during the evening we are able to wander backstage. today, china is no longer in the generation of the ""red sun"". now we can see a different side of china's red sun. the reality of china today is a microcosm of the world. china is not just a socialist country; it's no longer that simple. today the leaders of china have told the world they are constructing a socialist country with ""chinese characteristics"". but what are ""chinese characteristics""? ""night in china"" is my own view of what these characteristics are. this documentary is about the backstage of chinese characteristics; a side of its reality that is rarely examined. in this film you will not see daytime in china, as all of the stories occur between dusk and dawn. yet the night is like a tension that can be stretched so far that through the night you can better understand people's day. if china is a metaphor for a person, the day resembles the skin and hair. the night is the bones and inner organs. with this in mind my camera lens will be like a scope probing through the inside of a person's body. ""night in china"" will not only let you see china's reality, but it will also let you see its more surreal side. anqiju"

the investigation turns up a connection to the special united states navy squadron, the navy seals and other former us military officers working in japan. however, the first sniping was just the beginning; as more people are shot, the citizens of tokyo panic! what is the meaning of the rifle case and dice left behind? as his investigation progresses, conan soon finds himself in the sniper's cross-hairs, only to be saved by masumi who intervenes and takes the bullet in his stead. and, in the background, subaru okiya begins to make his move...

the sniper/culprit is kevin yoshino, while the entire murder plan was created by his master timothy hunter. kevin became hunter's student and helped him carry out the plan because he wanted to repay hunter for saving his life during their war operations in the middle east.

the reason for the serial killings was that waltz was jealous of hunter's achievements, which belittled his own actions. waltz set hunter up so he wouldn't get the silver star. he even ordered murphy to assassinate hunter, but the bullet failed to kill him, although a fragment of it remained in hunter's skull and damaged his optical nerves, severely impairing him. yoshino eventually discovered the deception, but waltz destroyed the evidence before it could be used in court, driving hunter into conceiving his revenge plan. the five sniping positions used for the murders, if viewed from ground level, combine to form a pentagon, which marks the five points of a silver star.

kevin attempted to kill waltz, but conan saved the latter by kicking a ball at him to knock him out of the bullet's way. kevin then attempted to kill conan, but subaru saved him. ran, unaware of conan's plan of saving ayumi decides to go after kevin herself but trips ends up being kevin's target. she is saved thanks to the combined effort of conan and subaru, and she manages to take kevin down after that - for ayumi, for sonoko and for sera. in the end, subaru okiya answers a call from james black with shuichi akai's voice. anime sirarthurconandoylecharacter sniper sequel eighteenthpart criminalinvestigation kôbunshizuno"
