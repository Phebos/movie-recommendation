After the show, Wong invites Chain-Ying to the Golden Gate Music Club for a party and the girl asks him for singing lessons. Chain-Ying and Wong begin to spend time together and Chain-Ying's friend, Sia-Lien Ho, tells Jien-Sien about his daughter's excursions with the actor and the fact that she has been missing school. Jien-Sien confronts Chain-Ying, who insists that in America, fathers have no rights over their daughters. When Chain-Ying says she loves Wong, Jien-Sien disowns her and then blames Duck Sook for his daughter's infidelity. Wong tells Chain-Ying that she must try to understand the old people's ways and then agrees to marry her, hoping that her father will now accept them.

The enraged father then goes to the theater owner and tells him to deport Wong, and the owner agrees not to renew the singer's contract, which is soon to expire. Several months later, Wong returns home one night and announces that he must return to China. Worried about his bride, who is now pregnant, he tells her that he will send for her when he has settled. Meanwhile, Duck Sook asks Jien-Sien to forgive his pregnant, lonely daughter, but he refuses.

Duck Sook and Mao Lee give the baby a Chinese name, Loy Lo, and an American name, Lulu, and when the girl grows up, Duck Sook teaches her Chinese dances and instills in her a love of the theater.

This year, however, he is afflicted with an infirmity that renders him unable to use his sword. Rather than give up this important commission and let the martial world know of his precarious health he means to entrust the consignment to two young knights in his manor, Hsiang Ting and Yun Piao-Piao. As it happens, these two are also betrothed; clearly they have their swordsmanship in common. At Peerless Manor, everyone is suspicious of malevolent strangers who may be sniffing around the silver transport. So when Le I appears astride a high-quality charger but otherwise clearly down on his luck, Hsiang Ting thinks Le I may be a spy for the bad guys in the Flying Tiger Manor. It doesn't help that Le I and Yun Piao-Piao hit it off right away. Even or especially when Le I saves Yun Piao-Piao from a Flying Tiger thug, Hsiang is not assuaged. Yun Piao-Piao is torn, though it seems that a certain sisterly compassion finally wins the day when she arranges to reunite Le I with his horse. It's a cute horse, and Le I seems rather attached ... When the silver convoy passes by a pagoda that happens to house the Flying Tiger gang, Chiao Hung, the Flying Tiger chief, tries to steal the shipment. To win the day, Hsiang and Le must fight together, despite their mutual disaffection.

In the ensuing celebration, a debate among the townspeople arises over which of the brothers has the best style, and the brothers become bitter rivals, neither of which is willing to admit that the other is his equal. Each sets up a martial arts school in the town. Years pass. A rich stranger comes to town with his two sons, and he places them in the two martial arts schools: One son in one school, and the other son in the other school. He vows to return in two years to test their knowledge. Meanwhile: Kung Fu Ching is a local boy in the town, and Ching is an unabashed martial arts fanatic who is trying to develop his own style of kung fu. He meets up with a wandering winemaker who also knows a lot of kung fu, and who encourages Ching to study more than one style of martial arts. Ching begins attending the martial arts school set up by the two feuding brothers mentioned above. They find out and kick him out of both schools. In desperation, he turns to the wandering winemaker and asks the winemaker to teach him his style of kung fu. After two years, the rich stranger returns to the town, and confesses that he is the brother of the bully the two brothers defeated years ago, and he has come to exact revenge. His two ""sons"" were merely spies he hired to provide him with information about the kung fu style of the two brothers. He handily defeats the two brothers individually, but when they toss aside their differences, they manage to do slightly better. But it takes the timely arrival of Kung Fu Ching to hand the rich stranger the defeat he so richly deserves... ...at which point the original bully arrives with eight henchmen. He's spent the all his time since his unfortunate defeat training in new styles of kung fu. Kung Fu Ching runs back to his master, and they prepare for the final showdown..."

A young prince was inadvertently killed when he kidnapped the boy to aid in his escape. 14 years later, Kao now a drunkard ridden with guilt, has been living with a young orphan by the name of Shu Geng. Also introduced are two wacky old bickering sorcerer couple, Old Man and Old Spinster, who are always competing with each other over the most trivial matters. Before long, the old nemesis of Kao, the powerful Socerer Bat, found his whereabouts and killed him. Harboring evil ambitions, Sorcerer Bat forces Shu Geng to impersonate the belated prince, with the intention that one day he can ruled alongside the would-be king. Shu Geng manages to escape, amid strange encounters with the clown in-the-jar, and meets the two even stranger bickering magician couple, who teach him their craft. The rest is a typical revenge motivated plot, in which the young prodigy learn the martial arts to defeat the villain. The setting however, is not so typical as the finale takes place in a sorcerer competition where Shu Geng faces not only the evil Bat, but also countless other sorcerers, each possessing his own unique magic and abilities. The choreography and inventiveness of the fights make this early collaboration of the Yuen brothers stand out among the work of Yuen Woo-Ping, who move on to become on of the most sought after action director in the business today.

Triad leaders vie for power on the streets, drug trafficking is getting out of hand and the thin blue line that separates justice from anarchy is being erased. Within a few months time, the Triads will control every major crime activity in the Pacific Rim and no law enforcement agency in the world will be powerful enough to stop them. But all of that changes when the 'Angel Terminators' arrive, a new police force led by Detectives Ida and Hon, two close friends who are like sisters and watch each other's back in the line of duty. Ida and Hon are the best there is and they take on some of the toughest cases that ordinary law enforcement won't go near and take on criminal figures that no cop would dare go after. Excelling at gun fighting and hand to hand combat techniques, Ida and Hon are given authorization by their superiors to use any means necessary to stop the crime wave and that includes the use of excessive force if need be. Together as one, they're fighting crime their own way...but now, these two beauties find themselves squaring off against old nemesis, Ken Zhang, a deposed crime lord who is forced into exile after his men first clashed with the Angel Terminators. Now he's back with his loyal bodyguards, led by Miss Nishiwaki and ready to reclaim the spoils of his near-fallen empire. After his return, Ken tries to reconcile with Carrie, his former mistress and Hon's cousin, who is not happy to see him and has given up her old life to marry a young detective who works with Ida and Hon. However, tragedy strikes the group in more ways than one when Hon's family gets in the way of Ken's business and murder starts hitting too close to home. After Ida is framed for the death of a fellow officer who was 'on the take', the battle to bring Ken down gets personal and for the Angel Terminators, 'martial law' will be the only law that counts!

Constantly bullied and abused in the marketplace, Hsiao finds himself taken under the personal tutelage of his boss, a skilled master of Chicken style kung-fu. Master Lu hopes that his young employee may one day provide backup muscle for his ongoing business struggles with a rival tong. Meanwhile, gawky split-toothed Hsiao continues to spend much of his free time at the farmers market trying to develop a relationship with the local noodle vendor (Ging-shun Mau) and his lovely daughter Ho Hwa (Yin-fei Kam). Hsiao clumsily romances the fiery-tempered Ho, who strongly rebukes his advances. Hsiao then stops a group of marketplace rowdies in a mischievous slapstick fight that admirably displays the acrobatic finesses of his new Chicken style technique. Master Lu rewards him with a promotion. Ho Hwa promptly informs Hsiao that his boss is not the upstanding citizen that he pretends and, again, she ridicules his flirtations, citing as ""stupid"" his bashful awkwardness and the pugilistic ineptitude of his showy shenanigans. She then proceeds to wallop the tar out of him with kung-fu techniques he has never before seen. Soon Hsiao discovers that Ho Hwa was right: His master's great wealth was actually acquired from illegal tax collections. Hsiao secretly begins to return the money to the people. Now master Lu and his followers spring their long-awaited trap, wiping out the rival tong with master Lu himself disposing of nemesis master Sher (O Yau-ma) using the Chicken style's signature backward-pecking elbow strikes. During the melee, master Lu's men also rumble with and rout Ho Hwa and her father. Afterward, father and daughter pack up and leave unannounced. They now realize that their kung-fu is simply no match for master Lu. Ho Hwa's mother had been murdered by Lu and she and her father quietly want revenge. For Hsiao, on the other hand, despite being well-treated, chasing off Ho and her father is the last straw. He has enough of master Lu's underhanded ways. Hsiao turns on his own tong and joins Ho and her father in the country which, of course, softens Ho's heart. Advanced kung-fu training now begin with Hsiao learning the Mantis style from the noodle vendor while Ho brushes up on her Eagle Claw. Together, they use Hsiao's knowledge of the Chicken style to invent a technique for confronting it. Master Lu eventually uncovers Hsiao's Robin Hood rebates to the people from his personal treasury. He quickly locates their hideout and the fighters face off for the final confrontation: Hsiao's acrobatics versus Lu's strategic movement. Ho Hwa keeps the gang at bay with her own acrobatic flips and graceful spinning high kicks followed in a blink by a low spinning sickle kick that floors her opponents. And master Lu struts his stuff with awesome power. But the tide of battle only turns to victory when Hsiao lets loose a mesmerizing stream of spinning aerial kicks that overwhelm the Chicken style's backward-pecking elbow strikes."

Mr Soh has been acting as a secret agent in Manchuria during the Japanese occupation. He is first seen spying on a meeting of Chinese soldiers as they plan a surprise ambush on the retreating Japanese Army. He is discovered and has to fight his way out, using fists, feet and then a machine gun. He rushes to inform the Japanese commanders of the plot, but is horrified to learn that Japan has done the unthinkable by surrendering unconditionally. Soh returns to his homeland to find a ravaged land of beaten people. Victimised by gangsters, occupation forces and corrupt local officials, the poor and the disenfranchised have lost the will to fight back. Using his ""Shao Lin"" skills (subtitle translation of Shorinji Kempo), he regularly champions the weak and teaches the black market thugs the error of their ways, becoming a regular guest at the local prison. He is seen to assist a former soldier, Otaki, who is seeking his lost wife at the bottom of a bottle, a fallen woman (Kiku) who has turned to prostitution after suffering rape by Russian soldiers, her little brother Kimio who gets injured by some American G.I.s who subsequently try to flee from accident. The Prison Governor warns him that the US Administration will not be so tolerant now that he has ""crippled"" the troops, suggesting a likely death sentence. He helps him to ""escape"" the jail and Soh leaves town in a hurry, pausing only to give advice to the band of orphans that he has befriended. Soh leaves the city of Osaka (central Japan) to go to the rural island of Shikoku where he finds a similar situation. He determines to bring new hope to the locals by teaching his martial arts skills to a growing band of followers. He gathers the loafers, ruffians and aimless, teaches them Shorinji Kempo (referred to as ""Shao Lin"" in subtitles) to build them up to be stronger physically and mentally. He meets some new characters, who he soon enlists in his school; Tomoda the young ex-soldier and his sister Miho. When the noodle-stall girl Noriko is raped by a gang of yakuza thugs, Soh and Tomoda dish out some rough justice (with some sharp scissors to one of the miscreant's tenderest flesh). Later, Tomoda and Miho are attacked and Tomoda has his arm cut off with a katana (Samurai sword). Soh avenges that with a visit to the local yakuza boss that leaves the boss with a dislocated arm and his minion missing a digit. Otaki, the former drunken soldier from Osaka joins the group, then in an emotional scene, discovers his wife is alive but has re-married after he was reported dead in the war. When the small-time local yakuza gangs are joined by familiar faces from Osaka seeking to expand their activities, it is time for action with a capital A. Before the final climactic face-off between Soh's students and the yakuza mob, there is time for Soh to receive an urgent message to see Kiku in Osaka. He returns to find the orphans caring for a terminally ill Kiku, who had turned to prostitution to help support them all. Soh experiences an epiphany and comes to recognise that ""Strength and Compassion must be together"" (Riki Ai Funi). In a typically cinematic finale, Soh's friend Otaki dies is killed by yakuza thugs paid to clear the honest poor from land to be used to build brothels and gambling dens. Soh goes on a final rampage to clear the yakuza right out of town forever.

One day the town ""leader"" convinces the rest of the peasants to kill the two brothers in order to acquire their land and share it among them. The two brothers are attacked and the boy is tortured and left for dead, while the sister is raped by all the men in the village. As a result from the trauma, she loses her sanity. The boy survives the tortures and the beatings and decides to take revenge, killing all the adult inhabitants from the village. During the killings the viewer gets to realize that most of the town's inhabitants are corrupt and filled with vices, while they hypocritically spent many years accusing the two brothers of committing the acts of sin and debauchery they themselves practiced.

School days filled with fist fights It is at the end of President RHEE Seung-man's Liberal Party regime, and the streets are filled with demonstration parades. And there is Tae-woong in his disheveled school uniform, ignorant to all the chaos that surrounds him. The only concern on his mind is to find the bully from Hongik High who beat up his friend and to take his revenge upon him. He successfully finds the kid and beats him up pretty good. However, he gets stabbed by furious Seung-moon, who eyewitnesses the whole incident. With a bloody knife stuck in his body, Tae-woong shows up at Seung-moon's house and tells him to pull out the knife himself. Meanwhile, Seung-moon's older sister Hae-ok finds Tae-woong and his reckless behavior rather attractive. Later, when the police hears about this incident, they interrogate Tae-woong to investigate Seung-moon and Hae-ok's father PARK Il-won, who is a politician of the opposition party. However, Tae-woong keeps his mouth shut and protects Seung-moon's family. Entering the heart of Myungdong PARK Il-won runs for office as an independent candidate. However, his campaign rally soon falls into a complete chaos when Salmosa, a political gang under the Jaeryong Gang who are paid off by the Liberal Party, intrudes into the rally area.

Around the same time, Hae-ok is transferred to a nearby school as a teacher and the two start to get more drawn to each other. In the mean time, the war between the Myungdong Gang and its rival Jaeryong Gang is ever escalating and ultimately, the Myungdong Gang collapses by a conspiracy set up by the Liberal Party, who supports the Jaeryong Gang. Even in the midst of the bloody demonstration of the Student Revolution in April 1960, Tae-woong goes around collecting debts from former politicians to earn a living. And finally after series of defeats, PARK Il-won gets elected to the National Assembly. Happiness doesn't last forever... After promising her father that she'll turn Tae-woong into an honest living man, Hae-ok and Tae-woong are married with her father consent.

When the masked gunmen make their way into the vault only to find that the Tojo gang's ten-million-yen deposit has mysteriously vanished, an already complicated situation gradually starts to spiral out of control. Meanwhile, in another part of town, psychotic yakuza Goro Majima (Kishitani) strikes out on his own to pay a visit to rival gang leader Kazuma Kiryu (Kitamura) and track down the missing mother of adorable youngster Haruka (Natsuo). It seems that Haruka's mother has some valuable information, and Majima is determined to find her at any cost. Now, as Majima makes his way through the neon-lit streets of Tokyo, Satoru (Shun Shioya) and his girlfriend, Yui (Saeko), embark on a bold robbery spree, and South Korean hitman Park (Yoo Gong) prepares to locate and terminate the thieves who absconded with the Toho gang's money.

For a long period of time China was a country that did not like to discuss darkness or night. For decades the ""Red Sun"" was the most direct form of allowed imagination. Under today's sun office buildings and construction sights dominate one's vision. But in the evening everything changes, and you can see the spiritual life of the people. Evenings everywhere provide us with an opportunity to see ourselves, as through a mirror's reflection. In the evenings humanity is always more sensitive and vulnerable. In its darkness we are cloaked in intimacy and obscurity. All through the day, people work hard to put on and maintain appearances, and daytime resembles a stage on which people perform. Yet during the evening we are able to wander backstage. Today, China is no longer in the generation of the ""Red Sun"". Now we can see a different side of China's red sun. The reality of China today is a microcosm of the world. China is not just a socialist country; it's no longer that simple. Today the leaders of China have told the world they are constructing a socialist country with ""Chinese characteristics"". But what are ""Chinese characteristics""? ""Night in China"" is my own view of what these characteristics are. This documentary is about the backstage of Chinese characteristics; a side of its reality that is rarely examined. In this film you will not see daytime in China, as all of the stories occur between dusk and dawn. Yet the night is like a tension that can be stretched so far that through the night you can better understand people's day. If China is a metaphor for a person, the day resembles the skin and hair. The night is the bones and inner organs. With this in mind my camera lens will be like a scope probing through the inside of a person's body. ""Night in China"" will not only let you see China's reality, but it will also let you see its more surreal side."

In particular, they focus on an ambitious sexagenarian who wants to follow in the footsteps of his idol Steve McQueen (specifically as a fireman in The Towering Inferno) and unintentionally causes the crew a lot of grief in the process. An exceedingly clever send-up of the Japanese film industry and a loving tribute to the work of extras, Extro is a cameo-filled mockumentary that derives its title from none other than filmmaker Nobuhiko Obayashi, who appears as a talking head interviewee to say, ""To me, extras are - Maestros."""

The film SEIRE takes an idea from this folk belief. Woojin, who has just became the father of a newborn baby, hears that Seyoung, whom he had once dated, has died. He goes to her funeral without telling his wife, and comes across Yeyoung, Seoyung's twin sister. Following this encounter, Woojin and his family experience a series of horrific misfortunes. SEIRE is a creative horror movie. It skillfully adopts the old convention of horror movies and, at the same time, modernizes the fear that comes from breaking the taboos of folk beliefs, crossing the border between reality and fantasy vaguely and ominously with bold camera moves and editing.

Suddenly, a bullet breaks through a window, strikes a man's chest and breaks a TV screen, causing everyone to panic. Conan stays calm and, using the zoom function on his tracking glasses to follow the path of the bullet to its source, spots the sniper. He and Masumi Sera, who had been present at the Tower as part of an assignment to shadow the victim, pursue the fleeing culprit on Masumi's motorcycle, but the chase takes a violent turn when the suspect uses a handgun and even hand grenades to take out his pursuers. Even the FBI get involved in the chase, but the culprit and the mysteries of the sniping end up vanishing into the ocean.

The investigation turns up a connection to the special United States Navy squadron, the Navy SEALS and other former US military officers working in Japan. However, the first sniping was just the beginning; as more people are shot, the citizens of Tokyo panic! What is the meaning of the rifle case and dice left behind? As his investigation progresses, Conan soon finds himself in the sniper's cross-hairs, only to be saved by Masumi who intervenes and takes the bullet in his stead. And, in the background, Subaru Okiya begins to make his move...

The sniper/culprit is Kevin Yoshino, while the entire murder plan was created by his master Timothy Hunter. Kevin became Hunter's student and helped him carry out the plan because he wanted to repay Hunter for saving his life during their war operations in the Middle East.

The reason for the serial killings was that Waltz was jealous of Hunter's achievements, which belittled his own actions. Waltz set Hunter up so he wouldn't get the Silver Star. He even ordered Murphy to assassinate Hunter, but the bullet failed to kill him, although a fragment of it remained in Hunter's skull and damaged his optical nerves, severely impairing him. Yoshino eventually discovered the deception, but Waltz destroyed the evidence before it could be used in court, driving Hunter into conceiving his revenge plan. The five sniping positions used for the murders, if viewed from ground level, combine to form a pentagon, which marks the five points of a Silver Star.

Kevin attempted to kill Waltz, but Conan saved the latter by kicking a ball at him to knock him out of the bullet's way. Kevin then attempted to kill Conan, but Subaru saved him. Ran, unaware of Conan's plan of saving Ayumi decides to go after Kevin herself but trips ends up being Kevin's target. She is saved thanks to the combined effort of Conan and Subaru, and she manages to take Kevin down after that - for Ayumi, for Sonoko and for Sera. In the end, Subaru Okiya answers a call from James Black with Shuichi Akai's voice."

He longs for legendary bug utopia Golden Canyon. When he helps dragonfly Master Water escape wasp guards that have chased him into the laboratory, he accepts the suggestion to travel together. But Master Water has no intention of going to Golden Canyon, and abandons Rube. At a nearby pond, a frog prince nearly swallows Master Water whole. Rube comes to his rescue, his parrying making the frog's lashing tongue become knotted in water reeds. When Rube sets him free, the frog sends his royal guards to escort them to a giant bird that flies over Golden Canyon. The giant bird is, in fact, an airplane. Jumping off the plane mid-route, they arrive at bug utopia only to find - a construction site. While scavanging for food, Master Water is captured by human kid Little Fatty, who collects bugs in a glass jar guarded by his pet lizard T-Rex. Rube comes to the rescue again, throwing himself against the jar with all his strength, knocking it off its shelf and knocking out T-Rex. When T-Rex regains consciousness, he starts to banquet on the fleeing critters only for Wasp Queen to arrive with her royal troops. Also duped by Master Water, she has repeatedly sent her guards to arrest him. But moved by Rube's go-it-alone courage, she now sends them to help. United for the first time, the bugs defeat the lizard, and together re-build their adopted homeland.
